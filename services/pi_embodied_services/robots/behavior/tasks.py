"""The BEHAVIOR-1K 2025 challenge tasks the env server offers, in the challenge's order.

The first two (``turning_on_radio``, ``picking_up_trash``) are the tasks CaP-X evaluates
(env_configs/r1pro/r1pro_pick_up_radio.yaml, r1pro_pick_up_trash.yaml); the rest are the
challenge's other 48 activities (CaP-X's env_configs/r1pro/b1k_*.yaml). The index is the
challenge's task index (``episode_index // 1e4`` in the demonstrations' metadata) and the
text is the challenge's task description, the planner's instruction.
